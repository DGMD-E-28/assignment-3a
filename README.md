# Joe’s Hotdogs Order System

## Assignment Overview
This project is part of **DGMD E-28: Developing Single Page Web Applications** and focuses on using **associative arrays** in JavaScript to build a simple order system.

## Requirements
You may use the following technologies:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for functionality (using associative arrays)

### 🚨 Ground Rules
- **Do not look up solutions online.** Use techniques covered in class.
- **Host the project online.** You may use any platform for deployment.
- **Enhancements are welcome,** but first, meet the basic requirements.

## 📌 Tasks
### 🔹 Part 1: Create an Associative Array
- Define an associative array (`menu`) that contains:
    - `hotdogs`: $4.00
    - `fries`: $3.50
    - `soda`: $1.50
    - `sauerkraut`: $1.00

### 🔹 Part 2: Display the Menu
- Dynamically display the menu items and prices on the webpage.

### 🔹 Part 3: Add Order Functionality
- Below the menu, add:
    - A **text input** for item names.
    - A **button** labeled “Add to Cart”.
    - A `<div>` for the **shopping cart**.
    - A **button** labeled “Checkout”.
- Use an **associative array** to track item quantities.

### 🔹 Part 4: Implement the Cart
- When an item is entered and **"Add to Cart"** is clicked:
    - If the item is valid (case-insensitive), increase its quantity.
    - Update the cart to show only items with quantity > 0.

### 🔹 Part 5: Checkout System
- Clicking **“Checkout”** should:
    - Calculate the total cost.
    - Display a **popup summary** of items and prices.
    - Reset the cart after checkout.
